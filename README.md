### Context:
I started this project on my 5th week of Turing with no prior coding experience. This project was done in about 12 hours split up throughout 5 days. 
### Contributors:
I was the only contributor as Laurel Bonal 
### Learning Goals:
The learning goals on this project were to demonstrate our knowledge of css, html, and javascript 
### Wins + Challenges:
# wins
This project had a lot of wins, I was able to do the basic html layout in less than an hour, and most of my styling done the first day I worked on the project. 
In this project, I did things I have never done on my own before. It solidified my understanding and confidence. 
# challenges 
The biggest challenge in this project was doing the timeout. I had never done a timeout function before and learning the syntax was very fun, but challenging.
